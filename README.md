Illumio Coding Challenge

2a) I tested my solution by first using the provided test cases in the provided .pdf file for this coding assignment.   Following that, I inputted several commands and attempted to see if they would trigger my error flags in my accept_package() method.

2b) I opted to use the pandas module within python because I have experience working with it and was aware that pandas is optimized to handle large data sets far better than any (or most) other python modules.

2c) If I had more time, I would have expanded my test cases to accept all-caps or first-letter capitalized versions of the direction and protocol inputs because it would have been a simple quality-of-life change and I think the capitalized version of any of those variables doesn't really change our understanding of what the packet contains. Furthermore, I would have added a more robust test suite to test more edge cases for inputs for the accept_package() method. In general, I would have made this whole class more fault-tolerant so the methods could spend more time doing what they should be doing instead of breaking because of small errors in input.

3) I'm currently most interested in being a part of the Data team at Illumio. If I had to rank my choices for preference it would be: 1) Data, 2) Policy, 3) Platform.
